
Task Description:
Create a Python script that calculates the total cost of items in a store and compares it with a given budget. The script should also calculate how much money is left or needed to reach the budget.
Python Task Example:
1. Define variables for the prices of three items.
2. Define a variable for the total budget.
3. Calculate the total cost of the items.
4. Compare the total cost with the budget.
5. Calculate the difference (either how much money is left or how much more is needed).
====


# Prices of three items
item1 = 120
item2 = 80
item3 = 50

# Total budget
budget = 300

# Calculate total cost
total_cost = item1 + item2 + item3

# Compare total cost with budget
print("Total cost of items:", total_cost)
print("Budget:", budget)

if total_cost <= budget:
    print("You are within the budget.")
    print("Money left:", budget - total_cost)
else:
    print("You are over the budget.")
    print("Extra money needed:", total_cost - budget)
